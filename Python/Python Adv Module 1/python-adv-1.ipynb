    "numpy (also styled NumPy, for \"Numerical Python\" and usually pronounced \"num-pie\") is a Python module for numerical computing. It provides functions and structures that make it easier to translate math from paper to code. For any mathematical application, it's likely there's a numpy function for it. A major advantage of numpy is its speed: most numpy functions are likely to be much faster than the equivalents that we can write. This is because most of the underlying implementations of these essential math concepts have been done in C, which is a much faster language than Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "A great resource for this module is the [numpy documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/). For any question more advanced than what we cover in these modules, it's generally best to consult the documentation first. As a shortcut, most of the documentation is in the form of *docstrings*, which we can access by calling `help` on anything. This is true of anything in Python: for example, if someone tells you to use a `map` and you want to figure out what that is, the first thing you can do is to call `help`:"

In physics classes, we solve the equation of motion above by setting $\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta$ and integrating. However, since we're solving this numerically, we don't have to do that approximation. For now, all we want is to get the acceleration `a` from the other information we have.\n",

Note that even though these are all size-1 arrays (i.e. just numbers wrapped in numpy arrays), we'll still use the arrays and not the numbers. This lets us keep the same standard when we're writing more complicated functions, so that we don't have to write a bunch of special cases.\n",
